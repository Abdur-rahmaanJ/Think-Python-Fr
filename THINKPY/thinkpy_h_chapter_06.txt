Fruitful functions
Many of the Python functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce return
values. But the functions we’ve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a
value or moving a turtle, but they don’t have a return value. In this chapter you will learn
to write fruitful functions.

6.1

Return values

Calling the function generates a return value, which we usually assign to a variable or use
as part of an expression.

e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)
The functions we have written so far are void. Speaking casually, they have no return
value; more precisely, their return value is None.
In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example is area,
which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:

def area(radius):
a = math.pi * radius**2
return a
We have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful function the return statement
includes an expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from this function
and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily
complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:

def area(radius):
return math.pi * radius**2
On the other hand, temporary variables like a can make debugging easier.
Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a conditional:

52

Chapter 6. Fruitful functions

def absolute_value(x):
if x < 0:
return -x
else:
return x
Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one runs.
As soon as a return statement runs, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow
of execution can never reach, is called dead code.
In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a return statement. For example:

def absolute_value(x):
if x < 0:
return -x
if x > 0:
return x
This function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the
function ends without hitting a return statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end
of a function, the return value is None, which is not the absolute value of 0.
>>> print(absolute_value(0))
None
By the way, Python provides a built-in function called abs that computes absolute values.
As an exercise, write a compare function takes two values, x and y, and returns 1 if x > y,
0 if x == y, and -1 if x < y.

6.2

Incremental development

As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.
To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called incremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging
sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the
coordinates ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y2 ). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:
distance =

q

( x2 − x1 )2 + ( y2 − y1 )2

The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other
words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?
In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The
return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.
Immediately you can write an outline of the function:

def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
return 0.0

6.2. Incremental development

53

Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more
complicated.
To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:
>>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
0.0
I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that
way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When testing a function, it is useful
to know the right answer.
At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start
adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences x2 − x1 and
y2 − y1 . The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1
print('dx is', dx)
print('dy is', dy)
return 0.0
If the function is working, it should display dx is 3 and dy is 4. If so, we know that the
function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If
not, there are only a few lines to check.
Next we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1
dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
print('dsquared is: ', dsquared)
return 0.0
Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be
25). Finally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1
dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
return result
If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of
result before the return statement.
The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns
a value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the
function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it
is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.
When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more
experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way,
incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.
The key aspects of the process are:

54

Chapter 6. Fruitful functions
1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if
there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.
3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or
consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not
make the program difficult to read.

As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that
returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two
legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.

6.3

Composition

As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the
perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.
Assume that the center point is stored in the variables xc and yc, and the perimeter point is
in xp and yp. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between
the two points. We just wrote a function, distance, that does that:

radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too:

result = area(radius)
Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:

def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
result = area(radius)
return result
The temporary variables radius and result are useful for development and debugging,
but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function
calls:

def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))

6.4

Boolean functions

Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside functions. For example:

def is_divisible(x, y):
if x % y == 0:
return True
else:
return False

6.5. More recursion

55

It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions;
is_divisible returns either True or False to indicate whether x is divisible by y.
Here is an example:
>>> is_divisible(6, 4)
False
>>> is_divisible(6, 3)
True
The result of the == operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by
returning it directly:
def is_divisible(x, y):
return x % y == 0
Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:
if is_divisible(x, y):
print('x is divisible by y')
It might be tempting to write something like:
if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
print('x is divisible by y')
But the extra comparison is unnecessary.
As an exercise, write a function is_between(x, y, z) that returns True if x ≤ y ≤ z or
False otherwise.

6.5

More recursion

We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might be interested to know that
this subset is a complete programming language, which means that anything that can be
computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten
using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few
commands to control devices like the mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all).
Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the
first computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early
computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing
Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend
Michael Sipser’s book Introduction to the Theory of Computation.
To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we’ll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical functions. A recursive definition is similar to
a circular definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being
defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful:
vorpal: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.
If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand,
if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol !, you
might get something like this:
0! = 1
n! = n(n − 1)!

56

Chapter 6. Fruitful functions

This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any other value, n, is n
multiplied by the factorial of n − 1.
So 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times 0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3
times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6.
If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can write a Python program to
evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case it should
be clear that factorial takes an integer:

def factorial(n):
If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1:

def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the
factorial of n − 1 and then multiply it by n:

def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
recurse = factorial(n-1)
result = n * recurse
return result
The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of countdown in Section 5.8. If
we call factorial with the value 3:
Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1...
Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1...
Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
of n-1...
Since 0 equals 0, we take the first branch and return 1 without
making any more recursive calls.
The return value, 1, is multiplied by n, which is 1, and the result is
returned.
The return value, 1, is multiplied by n, which is 2, and the result is returned.
The return value (2) is multiplied by n, which is 3, and the result, 6, becomes the return
value of the function call that started the whole process.
Figure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls.
The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return
value is the value of result, which is the product of n and recurse.
In the last frame, the local variables recurse and result do not exist, because the branch
that creates them does not run.

Leap of faith

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become
overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith”. When you come to a
function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you assume that the function works
correctly and returns the right result.
In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When
you call math.cos or math.exp, you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just
assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good
programmers.
The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we
wrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by
another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the
code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.
The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of
following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns
the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of n − 1,
can I compute the factorial of n?” It is clear that you can, by multiplying by n.
Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t
finished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!

6.7

One more example

After factorial, the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical function is fibonacci, which has the following definition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Fibonacci_number):
fibonacci(0) = 0
fibonacci(1) = 1
fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n − 1) + fibonacci(n − 2)
Translated into Python, it looks like this:

58

Chapter 6. Fruitful functions

def fibonacci(n):
if n == 0:
return 0
elif n == 1:
return 1
else:
return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small values of n, your head
explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work
correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together.

6.8

Checking types

What happens if we call factorial and give it 1.5 as an argument?

>>> factorial(1.5)
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
It looks like an infinite recursion. How can that be? The function has a base case—when n
== 0. But if n is not an integer, we can miss the base case and recurse forever.
In the first recursive call, the value of n is 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets
smaller (more negative), but it will never be 0.
We have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with
floating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The
first option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book. So
we’ll go for the second.
We can use the built-in function isinstance to verify the type of the argument. While
we’re at it, we can also make sure the argument is positive:

def factorial(n):
if not isinstance(n, int):
print('Factorial is only defined for integers.')
return None
elif n < 0:
print('Factorial is not defined for negative integers.')
return None
elif n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)
The first base case handles nonintegers; the second handles negative integers. In both
cases, the program prints an error message and returns None to indicate that something
went wrong:
>>> print(factorial('fred'))
Factorial is only defined for integers.
None
>>> print(factorial(-2))
Factorial is not defined for negative integers.
None

6.9. Debugging

59

If we get past both checks, we know that n is positive or zero, so we can prove that the
recursion terminates.
This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a guardian. The first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that follows from values that might cause an
error. The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code.
In Section 11.4 we will see a more flexible alternative to printing an error message: raising
an exception.

6.9

Debugging

Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging.
If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:
• There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition
is violated.
• There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.
• There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.
To rule out the first possibility, you can add a print statement at the beginning of the
function and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can
write code that checks the preconditions explicitly.
If the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and
display the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function
with values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2).
If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value
is being used correctly (or used at all!).
Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of
execution more visible. For example, here is a version of factorial with print statements:

def factorial(n):
space = ' ' * (4 * n)
print(space, 'factorial', n)
if n == 0:
print(space, 'returning 1')
return 1
else:
recurse = factorial(n-1)
result = n * recurse
print(space, 'returning', result)
return result
space is a string of space characters that controls the indentation of the output. Here is the
result of factorial(4) :

factorial 4
factorial 3
factorial 2
factorial 1
factorial 0

returning 1
returning 2
returning 6
returning 24
If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of output can be helpful. It takes
some time to develop effective scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of
debugging.

Exercise 6.2. The Ackermann function, A(m, n), is defined:



n + 1
A(m, n) = A(m − 1, 1)


A(m − 1, A(m, n − 1))

if m = 0
if m > 0 and n = 0
if m > 0 and n > 0.

See http: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Ackermann_ function . Write a function named ack
that evaluates the Ackermann function. Use your function to evaluate ack(3, 4), which should be
125. What happens for larger values of m and n? Solution: http: // thinkpython2. com/ code/
ackermann. py .
Exercise 6.3. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like “noon”
and “redivider”. Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same and the
middle is a palindrome.
The following are functions that take a string argument and return the first, last, and middle letters:

def first(word):
return word[0]
def last(word):
return word[-1]
def middle(word):
return word[1:-1]
We’ll see how they work in Chapter 8.
1. Type these functions into a file named palindrome.py and test them out. What happens if
you call middle with a string with two letters? One letter? What about the empty string,
which is written '' and contains no letters?
2. Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string argument and returns True if it
is a palindrome and False otherwise. Remember that you can use the built-in function len
to check the length of a string.
Solution: http: // thinkpython2. com/ code/ palindrome_ soln. py .
Exercise 6.4. A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a
function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note:
you will have to think about the base case.
Exercise 6.5. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when
a is divided by b, then gcd( a, b) = gcd(b, r ). As a base case, we can use gcd( a, 0) = a.
Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.
